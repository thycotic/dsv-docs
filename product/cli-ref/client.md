# Client

Client credentials enable applications to authenticate as the Role assigned to the client record.

## Commands that Act on Clients

---

| Command | Action |
| ----- | ----- |
| create | create a User in the vault |
| search | find clients by Role name |
| read | read a client’s details |
| delete | delete a User from the vault |

---

## Examples

### Create

The *create* command accepts as its `--role` parameter a fully qualified Role name, and creates a client credential assigned to that Role.

```BASH
dsv client create --role app-role
```

The output will include a *clientId* and *clientSecret* suitable for use during CLI installation, or within REST calls to authenticate as the Role assigned to the *clientId*.

```BASH
{

"clientId": "a59d37bf-4028-4eb9-9df4-6f1fea7d9298",
"clientSecret": "rV7l8l77DDwTLkdzWkL18UF9blycz3r9yfRhQTYICFc",
"role": "app-role"

}
```

> NOTE: The client Secret is available only when you create the client. If the Secret is lost, delete the client and create a new one.

### Search

The *search* command accepts as its `--query` parameter the name of a Role, and searches for clients having that Role.

```BASH
dsv client search --query dev-role
```

or

```BASH
dsv client search dev-role
```

### Read

The *read* command accepts a client ID as a parameter and returns the details for the given client. As with most commands, remember that you can apply flags to beautify, redirect, or reformat the returned material.

```BASH
dsv client read --client-id a59d37bf-4028-4eb9-9df4-6f1fea7d9298
```

### Delete

The *delete* command accepts a client ID as a parameter and deletes from the vault the indicated client.

```BASH
dsv client delete --client-id a59d37bf-4028-4eb9-9df4-6f1fea7d9298
```

When you delete a Client, it will no longer be usable. However, with the soft delete capacity of DSV, you have 72 hours to use the *restore* command to undelete the Client. After 72 hours, the Client will no longer be retrievable.

Should you want to perform a hard delete, precluding any restore operation, you can use the *delete* command’s `--force` flag.
