# Authentication

DSV supports several authentication methods.

## Password

Password authentication relies directly on individual User accounts. It requires an initial admin account with username + password authentication.

DSV encrypts the password in the config on successful authentication. This prevents Users from accidentally disclosing the password by sending the config to someone or by giving access to the computer to another person.

Routine activities associated with this authentication method include:

* creating a new User
* entering the username and password of the new User
* adding the new User to the DSV config

See the [Users](../cli-ref/user.md) portion of the CLI Reference for details.

## Client Credentials

In this method, you authenticate via a client id and a Secret generated by the vault. This suits situations requiring application or server access when no third party trust is feasible.

Client credentials tie to Roles, not User accounts, the significance being that Roles have a one-to-many relationship with User accounts. Using Roles-based authentication allows you to efficiently apply uniform authentication requirements to collections of Users.

Routine activities associated with the client credentials authentication method include:

* creating a new Role
* adding the new Role to the DSV config
* creating new client credentials using the new Role
* invoking the *init* command and supplying those client credentials

See the [Roles](../cli-ref/role.md) portion of the CLI Reference for more information.

## Thycotic One Authentication

Users can authenticate into DSV using a Thycotic One account. To add a User with Thycotic One authentication:

* Create a user and assign credentials using the following format:
    
    **```dsv user create --username thyoneuser@yourorganization.com --provider thy-one```** 

* The user will receive an email with a link to both confirm their email address and setup a password.

* Once the Thycotic One User follows the link and sets a password, they will be ready to authenticate to DSV.

## Third Party Authentication

Besides ThycoticOne, DevOps Secrets Vault works with third party authentication providers, including:

**AWS IAM**: DSV uses the current AWS profile to generate a signed request which the vault validates against AWS. You can use this with EC2 instances and with a Lambda that is assigned an IAM Role or an IAM User account. See [Authentication: AWS](./authaws/index.md)

**Azure MSI**: DSV uses the assigned Azure Managed Service Identity (MSI).  See [Authentication: Azure](./authazure/index.md)

**GCP Service Accounts**: DSV uses GCP's service accounts to enable secrets access to just about anything that can be assigned a service account.  Google Compute Engines (GCE) may also be assigned service accounts and authenticated through GCE metadata.  See [Authentication: Azure](./authgcp/index.md)

**OIDC Provider** DSV connects to Thycotic One, which in-turn may connect to any OIDC provider.  See [Authentication: OIDC](./authoidc/index.md)
